# Twitch Monitor (Heroku Version)
ðŸ¤– **A simple Discord bot that maintains a list of live Twitch streams in a Discord channel.**

Many bots simply post to a Discord channel when a streamer has gone live, the post gives you no indication as to whether the streamer is *still* live or what their status is, leading to the information in the channel becoming stale quickly.

This bot creates a card in the channel which updates throughout the duration of the streamer's stream, with uptime, viewcount, and a screenshot of their stream.

Once the streamer goes offline, the bot deletes the card, ensuring that the posts in your discord channel are all up-to-date and only referring to streamers who are live right now.

Multiple streamers can be added to the watch list, at your (or any server admin's) discretion.

## Features
* No annoying @everyone mentions.
* Monitors Twitch streamers and posts on discord when they're live.
